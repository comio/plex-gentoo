My Plex ebuilds.

You need Plex Pass in order to have a full featured Plex installation. Please visit https://www.plex.tv/features/plex-pass/ to have more information regarding subscription to the service. Remember also that your subscription will help Plex to give you a better service!

If you prefer to work with the last "Pass" (a.k.a. Beta) you can switch on pass branch adding "sync-git-pull-extra-opt = -b pass" statement to your repos.conf file.

Of course, Plex is owned by Plex Inc. (https://www.plex.tv/about/).
